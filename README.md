## Overview

![screenshot](/public/desktop-preview.png)

First project done by me using React.js, based on the challenge from the devChallenges website. Very happy with the result and I'm still more willing to dedicate myself more and more to this technology, I intend to improve it whenever necessary and I accept feedback :)

The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) was to build a componentization of buttons where the value can be passed through parameters and the end user will be able to modify it through a form.
